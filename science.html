<h2>How do satellites help in <i>WEATHER PREDICTION</i>??</h2>
<h2>Ans-These current satellites are called <mark>Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES)</mark>. Because they stay above a fixed spot on the surface, they provide a constant vigil for the atmospheric "triggers" for severe weather conditions such as tornadoes, flash floods, hail storms, and hurricanes. This is how they help in weather prediction.</h2>

<h2>How do satellites help in <i>NAVIGATION</i>??</h2>
<h2>Ans-To accomplish this, each of the 31 satellites emits signals that enable receivers through a combination of signals from at least four satellites, to determine their location and time. <b>GPS satellites carry atomic clocks that  provide extremely accurate time</b>.This is how they help us in navigation.</h2>

<h2>How do satellites help in <i>DISASTER MANAGEMENT</i> across India??</h2>
<h2>Ans-Satellites enable communication during disasters when terrestrial infrastructure is down or over capacity.  <u>Satellite internet is critical to facilitating first response efforts by keeping airports, shelter locations, healthcare facilities, and utility operations up and running</u>.This is how they help us in disaster management.</h2>
