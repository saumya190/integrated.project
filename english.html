<p id="Csspara" class="classpara"> Ila Sachani's journey began in the quiet settings of Amreli, Gujarat,
where she was born in a farmer's family. Her life presented its difficulties from the beginning, as she was
born with her hands hanging loose by her sides. She couldn't use her hands. Everyone in her family supported
her. Ila's mother and grandmother encourage her and were focused to help her overcome her challenge. 
They both were skilled in the traditional art of <i>Kathiawar</i> embroidery. So, they decided to share this art
with Ila. They taught her to create many different beautiful patterns using her feet! It was certainly not an easy 
task, but she accepted the challenge with determination. Threading a needle was hard, but Ila didn't gave up and 
became an expert at a young age. Her younger brother and sister helped her too. She had learned many different 
styles, even ones from outside Gujarat- <i> Kacchi, Kashmiri, Lucknawi</i>, and others. At first, Ila used to craft fine designs only for her family and friends, who were amazed by her talent. Soon, the people in the village, too,discovered Ila's special skill and the admiration for her work began to spread. Soon, the word reached the government office in Surat, they were moved by Ila's story and impressed by her work. They decided to displaysome samples of her embroidery at a state exhibition. People observed the beauty woven by her feet and readilypurchased the creations. Ila became famous after this. Ila was encouraged by this popularity and decided to participate in more exhibition, not just within state but at the national level. She received many awards and honours, not just for art but also the willpower. Ila Sachani, once a farmer's daughter facing a tough challenge,worked hard and became a celebrated artist and the receiver of the <u>President's Medal</u>.She proved through her creations, that challenges can be turned into victories with focus,
hard work, positivity, and never giving up. Her embroidery, created by her feet reminds us that art has the power to
rise above physical boundaries and touch the soul.</p>
