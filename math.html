<p>-Aryabhatta was the first of the major mathematician-astronomers from the classical age of Indian mathematics and Indian astronomy. His works include the Aryabhatiya and the Arya-siddhanta. For his explicit mention of the relativity of motion, he also qualifies as a major early physicist. He was the one who formulated the first 10 decimal places. He also gave the algorithms that are used for obtaining a square root and a cubic root. He also explained how we should use the decimal number system.</p>

<p>-He is the father of Indian Mathematics who significantly contributed to mathematics and astronomy and discovered theories like solar system rotation, approximation of pi, trigonometry, place value system and zero, and many others.</p>

<p>-He discovered an approximation of pi, 62832/20000 = 3.1416. He also correctly believed that the planets and the Moon shine by reflected sunlight and that the motion of the stars is due to Earth's rotation.</p>

<p>-Aryabhata, a great astronomer of the classic age of India was the one who invented the digit “0” (zero) for which he became immortal but later on is given to Brahmagupta who lived around a century later 22, another ancient Indian mathematician.</p>

<p>-Even though he did not explicitly use a zero in his work, his understanding of the place-value system inherently required the concept of zero. It is worth noting that Aryabhata used the word 'kha' for positional purposes, hinting towards a placeholder concept similar to zero.</p>

<p>-Aryabhatta is one of the most renowned Indian mathematicians. He was the one who formulated the first 10 decimal places. He also gave the algorithms that are used for obtaining a square root and a cubic root. He also explained how we should use the decimal number system.</p>

<p>-Aryabhata became famous as a mathematician and astronomer. In his only surviving work, Aryabhatiya, he covered a wide range of topics, such as extracting square roots, solving quadratic equations, and predicting eclipses.</p>
